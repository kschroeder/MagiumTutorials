Identities
==========

Identities are used to represent personalized data for an individual test.  Out of the box there are only two kinds of identities; Customer and Admin.  Most often they will be used to log in to some part of the site, such as the account pages or the admin pages.  But they can also contain other information, such as billing and shipping addresses.

There is a very good likelihood that your identities are not going to be my identities and so most identities are going to need to be [configurable](../Getting Started/Configurable Elements.MD).  Please make sure you have read that document before continuing.
