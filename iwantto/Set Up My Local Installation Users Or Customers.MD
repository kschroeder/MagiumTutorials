How Do I Set Up My Local Installation Users Or Customers?
======================================

Magium Magento expects certain users to exist by default.  They are used for existing customer checkouts and for the admin.  The usernames and passwords can be changed using the configurable method or via environment variables.  However, if you would like to do the opposite and change your environment to support the defaults here is what you need to do.

Default Customer
----------------

The default customer settings are

| Name | Value|
| ---------- | --------------|
| Username or email address | test@example.com |
| Password | password         |

Default Admin User
------------------

The default administrative user setting is

| Name | Value|
| ---------- | --------------|
| Username | admin |
| Password | Password1         |
